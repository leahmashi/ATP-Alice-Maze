# Alice In Wonderland Maze

## Ever wanted to go down the rabbit hole?   
Well now you can join Alice on her adventures through Wonderland!  
Starting by following the white rabbit you can find the secret entrance.  
Once there you'll enter the queens gardens and try to help the poor card get to the queen,  
while painting the roses red :wink:, but watch out the garden maze could change.  
If you get to the queen you'll be able to enjoy the tea party with the hare, the mouse and the mad hatter enjoy!  

## Some technical details:  
We used Javafx, log4j, CSS and a MVVM (Model, View, View-Model) Architecture.  
For generating the different mazes there are 2 options using a simple or a randomized prim algorithm.  
For solving the mazes we implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and Best First Search.  

Here's a demo of the game:
